# Rowing machine progress tracker

## Goal

- Make it easy for a person/team to keep track of their rowing results

## How

- Definitely app based
- Maybe some kind of web portal as well for management
  - View large data sets
  - Manage data

## Challenge

- How to make the input process simple
  - So many different combinations of training
  - What you track can really depends on
    - who you are actually targeting
    - what type of training scheme do you have

## Existing solutions

- Erg (Alpha) & 2000
  - My failed attempt at making rowing apps
- There's one from concept2 I think?
