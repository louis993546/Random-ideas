# Pomodoro + Time tracker

## Goal

- Make it easier to keep track of your work time
- A step towards the ultimate time tracking

## Consists of

- Phone app
- Smartwatch app
- REST API
- Database

## What's special

- It's design by me, for me
- It will be free (at least for now)
  - If I want to make it public, I can see if there's any way to make the
  synchronization work with user's own cloud storage or something (i.e. I don't
  wanna pay)

## Slightly long term future

- Statistics
