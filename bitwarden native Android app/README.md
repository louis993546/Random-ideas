# bitwarden native Android app

## Why
- Why not? Everything's open source anyway.

## What I want to do in a personal level

- TDD
- Even more Kotlin
- Security & Encryptions
- Target latest SDK
- Better UX
  - It's not bad right now, but there are definitely room for improvement
    - On-board experience
    - Help user to get it all up and running (esp. with Auto-fill service)

## Rough ideas
- Bottom nav or tab layout (depends on how many tabs I want to have/gestures
  that can conflicted with view pager)
- a lot more animation
- search is the primary action, not add
- password generator is a good idea, but it should be integrated into the system
 in a better way. E.g. if it cannot find matching site, it should have an item
 that add a new domain instantaneously in 1 click
- add something to sort items based on frequency of use
- I assume some kind of security audit would be nice?
- cryptography
- long term plan: integrate with other password manager API, time based 2FA, etc
