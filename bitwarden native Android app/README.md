# bitwarden native Android app

## Why
- Why not? Everything's open source anyway.

## What I want to do in a personal level

- TDD
- Even more Kotlin
- Security & Encryptions
- Target latest SDK
- Better UX
  - It's not bad right now, but there are definitely room for improvement
    - On-board experience
    - Help user to get it all up and running (esp. with Auto-fill service)
