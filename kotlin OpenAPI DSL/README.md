# OpenAPI DSL (written in Kotlin)

[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) is a specification on
the documentation of a REST(ful) API. It is probably one of the most popular
specification since it originated from Swagger.

## Anything existing projects?

- [This one](https://github.com/derveloper/kotlin-openapi3-dsl)
  - It says that there are still a whole bunch of stuff incomplete
  - Has not been updated for 2 months
  - This one is for v3, which is still in progress right now

## What should the DSL do

- Generate OpenAPI v2 & v3 `yaml` file
- Parse yaml file into `OpenAPI` object
- and more?
