# Random ideas

Over the years, I have a ton of random papers, files, notes, etc on random ideas that I have had. I have decided to just move them all to here because:

- Putting it on note taking services (Evernote/OneNote/Simplenotes) means that there is a single point of failure. If they went out of business/the server goes down, I cannot access it. Meanwhile, using git means that there can be as many local copies as I want, and it is pretty easy to move from 1 remote to another. Also, I feel restricted by the files that I can attach in each services.
- Putting everything on paper is just a stupid idea for an expat in 2018
- Putting everthing on Google Drive/Dropbox has similar problem with all the note taking services. It is more flexible in terms of what I can attach, but for quick ideas, using Google Docs are just often overkill. Markdown usually can get the job done already.
