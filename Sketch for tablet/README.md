# Sketch for tablet

- Sketch is still the best, but it requires a Mac
- All the computer-based tools makes it harder to test it on real devices
- A lot of tablets now should be powerful enough to do complex layout shit
- Ideally cross-platform, but I don't know if there's standard API for stylus support
- It'll be more realistic to be an iOS only app
- Talk to designers to know what they are looking for
- What do I want?
  - Easy access to online resources (Google Drive, Dropbox, Upsplash, Stock photos, etc)
  - Git-based version control
    - If the file is not 1 zip file, but rather a folder, it can make diff possible!
    - Maybe designers can also make pull requests to update resources directly to the repo!?
  - Apple pencil support
  - Test the prototype on the iPad itself
  - Multi-display support (since in iOS each app need to specify that)
  - Live-stream support (just for fun)
  - To be an open-source app, not a service
  - Works well with all the necessary file formats
    - .psd/.ai/.xd to import stuff from the Adobe ecosystem
    - .jpg/.png/.webp/.gif obviously
    - .svg/.xml/.pdf/.9-patch for all the existing resources
