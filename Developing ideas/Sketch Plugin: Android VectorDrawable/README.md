# Sketch Plugin: Android VectorDrawable

- There's got to be a better way to turn sketch artboard into `VectorDrawable`
- What't the problem right now
  - Android's `VectorDrawable` is quite limited
  - Sketch's svg export is not garuntee to work on Android
  - There is no easy way to debug which part of the svg tag is broken
- Solution
  - A sketch plugin that export straight to `VectorDrawable`
  - Abilities
    - Artboard -> svg (by sketch)
    - Find tags that's not supported in Android and stop export
    - Warning against big vectors and why that's not a good idea
  - Nice to have abilities
    - Optimization w/ SVGO
    - Export to different versions of Android w/ different limitations
    - Actually change the sketch file to use supported tags (e.g. instead of mask, change the shape of path)
  - Implemtnataion
    - [This is how Google converts svg to `VectorDrawable`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/master/sdk-common/src/main/java/com/android/ide/common/vectordrawable/Svg2Vector.java)
    - (It's personal) I want to see how to do that in Kotlin Multiplatform
    - For a sketch plugin, it needs to be JS
