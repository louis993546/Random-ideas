# Email redirector

## Why
- I removed the email client and now there is no default email client

## How
- Make a fake app that handles `mailto`, and it just opens your choice of
browser and web email client

## TODO
- Name the app
- Find out how to open a specific browser that user has
- Find as many web email client (so that the use can choose)
- Make the app
