# Phone for sysadmin/developer

## Target audience
- sysadmin/developer
- people who want/need coding done OTG
- just tech nerd general

## What's wrong with phone right now
- software keyboard + generic auto complete = impossible to finish a line
- not a lot of phones have good battery life

## What I propose
- Phone with a horizontally slide out keyboard
- Large not-super-wide display
- replaceable battery
- more ports
- function > form

## Spec
- Latest and greatest SnapDragon SoC
- 8GB+ RAM
- Super stock latest version of Android w/
  - A keyboard app that suggest coding terms instead of normal terms
  - Terminal app
  - etc
- Horizontal slide out keyboard
  - 5 rows +
  - incorporate arrow keys somehow
