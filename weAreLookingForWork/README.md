# we(AreLookingFor)Work

## Why

Job hunting is hard + annoying + often tedious + soul sucking, there's got to be
a better way!

## Problem now

### Job seeker

- Send a shit ton of CV and cover letter
- Schedule interviews
  - Phone call vs VoIP vs in person
  - Where
  - When
- Need fast internet connection + place to conduct not in person interviews
- Sometimes you just want to have a productive place to get the CV and other
stuff done
- Maybe you want some guidence from other people

### Recruiters & job hunter/giver/companies

- There are just way too many online platform
- Skype interview is not always the best to know what the candidate is like
- Sometimes you just want to have informal chat first
- Maybe what your company do is more classified
- Maybe your office is ugly/small/both
