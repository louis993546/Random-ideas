# A better housing company

## Motivation

I moved out of my parent's house last year, fly to another continent, and start
my life again in a new city, with new people, in new environment. There are a
lot of things I love about the experience, but housing is definitely NOT one of
them. Finding share flat in Berlin in hard: the good ones are not cheap, and the
cheap ones are never good. Sometimes you might even got expensive ones that are
not good. That makes me think about what I would do to improve the experience

## Things I like

- Some of the people are very nice
- Most of the city have decent public transport
- Most apartments have decent views & airflow
- Apartments are still not too expensive
- Just living alone/moving out in general

## Things I hate
- Hard to meet potential roommate
- No easy to use system to find apartment
- Landlords can be very unpredictable/lazy
- Usually no easy way to communicate with roommates, landlords, and neighbors
- Contracts & Terms & Conditions are usually very hard to understand
- Fee are often not completely disclosed

## What I think could be the solution

<b>A housing company that owns & maintains apartments through out the city</b>

- I don't think making another website that connect tenant and landlords
together is gonna solve anything (i.e. [xkcd 927](https://xkcd.com/927/))
- I think what Medici (QUATERS specifically) and Neon Wood has been doing is a
step in the right direction
  - What I like
    - Information of the living environment documented online
    - Looking to improvement the atmosphere (i.e. Community forming)
    - Decent outreach team (quick responses mostly)
  - What I don't like
    - Somewhat false advertising on the price
      - Radio tax not included
      - Fixes not really included
      - Admin fee not included
    - Lack of actual personal connection with their tenant, e.g. bad
    maintenance speed
- What I would do exactly
  - Rent out apartments through out the city
  - Only start with small-ish apartments (2-5 bedrooms)
  - Make a damn good website on what each apartment is offering
    - Facility
    - Location
    - Pricing
    - etc.
  - One of the tenant becomes the manager-type guy of the apartment
    - Why
      - Make the channel of communication easier to deal with
    - Responsibility
      - Ensure the apartment is clean (schedule cleaning, report issues, etc.)
    - Benefit
      - Decent discount on rent
  - Have an easy to use channel of communication
    - Discord or Slack will probably get the job done for now
      - 1 channel for each apartment
      - They can create their own groups or something
    - DON'T make stupid apps that no one likes to use
  - Do everything I can do make their life easier
    - Online payment
    - Enough staff to make sure responses are quick at all time
    - Clear move-in tutorials on what they need and what has been dealt with
    - Private channel for feedbacks
    - Public forums to prioritize those feedbacks
  - Decoration
    - Some rooms have no furnitures so they can decorate themselves
      - Can buy back their furnitures when they move out when the cost in under
      a certain threshold
        - the price needs to be very transparent
    - Allow them to drill or take stuff onto the wall at a small fee
      - the price needs to be very transparent
  - Equipment
    - All the share basics will be there by default
      - Washing machine
      - Dryer (if possible & necessary)
      - Cloths hanger (if necessary)
      - Ironing board
      - Iron

      - Shower curtain
      - Silverwares (plates, bowls, spoon, fork, knife, cutting board, cups)
      - Oven
      - Dishwasher (if possible)
  - General business model
    - Get people to move in, and keep them w/ love and care
    - Let the experience of the tenants to be the promotion
    - Low profit margin (to make sure the propagation of brand name first)
  - Long term business model (if somehow it survived)

        - Something that's already available in market
